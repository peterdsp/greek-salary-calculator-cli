## Explanation of the Calculation

1.  **Gross Monthly Salary**: The starting salary provided by the user.
2.  **Annual Gross Salary**: Calculated as `gross_monthly_salary * 14` since there are 14 monthly payments in the year. 3. **Employee's Insurance Contribution**: Calculated based on whether the gross salary exceeds the insurable earnings ceiling. 4. **Annual Insurance Contribution**: The monthly insurance contribution multiplied by 14. 5. **Annual Taxable Income**: The gross annual salary minus the annual insurance contribution. 6. **Total Tax**: Calculated based on the taxable income using the given tax brackets and rates. 7. **Tax Credit**: Based on the number of children and reduced by income above ‚Ç¨12,000. 8. **Final Tax**: The total tax reduced by the tax credit. 9. **Net Annual Income**: The gross annual salary minus the insurance contributions and final tax. 10. **Net Monthly Income**: The net annual income divided by 14.
